# Internal combustion cycle

- Converts gas into force.
  - To turn wheels on road.
- High-energy fuel (like gasoline) in a small enclosed space.
  - Igniting it released a lot of energy.
    - In the form of an expanding gas.
- Every car with a gasoline engine uses a **four-stroke combustion cycle**.
  - To convert casoline into motion.
  - Called the **Otto cycle**.
    - Invented in 1867 by Nikolaus Otto.
  - Four strokes are:
    - **Intake** stroke (suck)
    - **Compression** stroke (squeeze)
    - **Combustion** stroke (bang)
    - **Exhaust** strike (blow)

- **Piston** is connected to the **crankshaft** by a **connecting rod**.
  - As the crankshaft spins, the cycle starts each time.
- Steps of the cycle:
  - 1. The piston starts at the top.
    - Intake valve opens.
    - Piston moves down.
      - To let the engine take in a cylinder full of air and gasoline.
    - This is the **intake stroke** (suck).
    - Only the tiniest drop of gasoline is needed with air for this to work.
  - 2. Piston moves back up.
    - To compress the fuel-air mixture.
      - This is the **compression stroke **(squeeze).
      - Makes explosion more powerful.
  - 3. Piston reaches the top of its stroke.
    - Spark plug emits a spark.
      - To ignite the gasoline.
    - The gasoline charge in the cyclinder explodes.
      - Drives the pistoen down.
    - This is the **combustion stroke** (bang).
  - 4. Piston reaches the bottom of its stroke.
    - Exhaust valve opens.
      - Exhaust leaves the cylinder through tailpipe.
    - This is the **exhaust stroke** (blow).
  - 5. Engine is ready for the next cycle.
    - Intakes in (sucks in) another charge of air and gas.
- Linear motion of pistons converted into rotational motion via crankshafts.
  - Rotational is helpful as it helps to turn car wheels.
