# Manual transmission

## The clutch

![Clutch](images/clutch.png)

- This is the clutch wheel.

![Flywheel](images/flywheel.png)

- The clutch is attached to the flywheel.
  - Which is bolted to the engine.
  - Always spinning if the car is running.

![Transmission input shaft](images/input-shaft.png)

- The components inside this assembly allow power flow to be disconnected.
  - From the transmission input shaft

![Transmission input shaft connection](images/input-shaft-connection.png)

- The transmission input shaft does not connect to the engine crankshaft or flywheel.

![Friction disc or clutch plate](images/friction-disc.png)

- Connection to the engine is via a sliding friction disc.
  - Also called a clutch plate.

![Pressure disc](images/pressure-disc.png)

- The clutch plate (or friction disc) is between the flywheel surface and the pressure disc.

![Clutch plate movement](images/clutch-plate-movement.png)

- The clutch plate assembly is attached to the transmission input shaft.
  - But has the movement mechanics to slide back and forth.

![Pressure disc applying pressure to flywheel](images/pressure-disc-squeeze.png)

- The pressure disc can comes in contact with the engine crankshaft or flywheel.
  - Depending on the driver's pedal input.

![Clutch plate dampening springs](images/clutch-plate-dampening-system.png)

- For smooth power delivery, the clutch plate has springs.
  - Acts as a dampening system.
  - Springs continously absorb vibrations.
  - Protects against power flow anomalies.

![Diaphragm spring](images/diaphragm-spring.png)

- The pressure disc is connected to the diaphragm spring.
  - This naturally presses the pressure disc to the flywheel.

![Diaphragm spring outer cover](images/diaphragm-spring-outer-cover.png)

- The outer cover of the diaphragm spring has hooks.
  - To be held securely in place.
  - Also acts as a fulcrum.
    - A pivot point at which the pressure disc turns

![Leaf springs](images/leaf-springs.png)

- There are additional springs, such as these leaf springs.
  - These aid the diaphragm spring's outer cover.

![Clutch fork](images/clutch-fork.png)

- This is the clutch fork.
  - Sits at the center of the diaphragm spring.

![Clutch fork pivoting](images/clutch-fork-pivot.png)

- As the clutch fork pivots, it presses in on the diaphragm spring's inner pongs.
  - Clutch fork is attached to a throwout bearing.
    - Attached to the driver's clutch pedal.
  - This lifts the outter edge and the connected pressure plate.

## Gears

![Gear set](images/gear-set.png)

- Each speed has a gear set.
  - Input speed is different from output speed.
  - Speed gears in a constant mesh transmission are always linked.

![Gear teeth](images/gear-teeth.png)

- Diagonal and helical teeth on cogs (except for reverse which has straight teeth).
  - For smooth rotations.
  - Quieter operations.

![Main shaft](images/main-shaft.png)

- Engine power flows through the main shaft.

![Countershaft](images/counter-shaft.png)

- Engine power then flows to the countershaft.

![Differential assembly](images/differential-assembly.png)

- Engine power then flows to the differential assembly.

![Axles](images/axles.png)

- Engine power then flows through the axles (depending on the drivetrain, i.e. AWD, RWD, or FWD).
